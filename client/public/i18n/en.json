The company has implemented a production line for virus vaccines on cell cultures that meet the GMP-WHO standard. Investments have been made in automatic equipment, including a fully automated production line that meets WHO standards, such as automatic bottle washing machines, automatic dosage dispensers, automatic aluminum cap sealers, labeling machines, automated finishing machines, and vaccine freeze-drying machines. The company has also invested in sending technical personnel to Europe to learn about new technologies. The quality control department (GLP) has been upgraded to an ISO 17025 standard laboratory, serving both product quality assessment and research and development (R&D) activities. The warehouse system (GSP) is designed in a systematic manner, from raw material storage to finished product and cold storage, adhering to GSP standards and maintaining a neat and organized arrangement.",
